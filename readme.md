# Real-World Projects: Applying My College Learnings

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This space is dedicated to creating and sharing real-world projects that apply everything I learned in college, discipline by discipline. The goal is to practice, retain knowledge, and help others by making these projects open source for the community.

## Purpose

The main objectives of this repository are:

1. **Practice**: Reinforce the concepts and skills I acquired during my studies.
2. **Retention**: Ensure long-term retention of knowledge by applying it to practical projects.
3. **Community Support**: Provide valuable resources and projects that others can learn from and contribute to.
