# BookmeHaniel - Online Ticketing System Architecture

## Overview

BookmeHaniel is designed as an online ticketing system with the ability to scale efficiently while maintaining high availability, performance, and security. The architecture leverages modern cloud technologies and best practices for web applications, including content delivery, caching, background processing, and more.

## Architecture

### 1. Front-End Layer
   - **CDN (Content Delivery Network):** Distributes static content like images, CSS, JavaScript, etc., to servers close to users. Examples: AWS CloudFront, Akamai, Google Cloud CDN.
   - **Web Servers (Nginx/ALB):** These servers distribute user requests to the appropriate services in the application layer. An **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** is used to balance the load between multiple instances of web servers.

### 2. Application Layer
   - **Application Servers (EC2 Instances):** Multiple instances of the application server (e.g., Django, Node.js) running the business logic. These instances are scaled to handle increased traffic.
   - **Microservices:** Modular components of the application that can be scaled independently. Examples: Checkout Service, Seat Selection Service, Order Management Service.

### 3. Asynchronous Processing Layer
   - **Job Queue (Redis):** Redis is used to manage job queues that are processed in the background. The job queue stores tasks that will be processed by workers asynchronously.
   - **Workers:** Processes that execute background jobs, such as sending emails, processing payments, etc. Tools like **Celery (Django)** or **Bull (Node.js)** are used to manage these workers.
   - **Pub/Sub (Redis):** Redis is also used for Pub/Sub, where jobs are published, and workers are notified to process them.

### 4. Database Layer
   - **Relational Database (RDS - MySQL):** Stores structured data like users, orders, and seats. Optimized indexes are used to speed up queries.
   - **Elasticache (Redis/Memcached):** Used for caching frequently accessed data, reducing the load on the relational database.

### 5. Session and State Management Layer
   - **Session Store (Redis/Elasticache):** Redis is used to store user sessions and temporary data that needs to be accessible by all server instances. This ensures that sessions persist even if the user is redirected to a different server.
   - **Virtual Waiting Room:** Implemented with Redis to manage access tokens that control the flow of users into the seat selection process.

### 6. Security Layer
   - **WAF (Web Application Firewall):** A firewall that protects against attacks like SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), etc. Examples: AWS WAF, Cloudflare.
   - **Authentication and Authorization:** Secure authentication system to verify identities and control access to different parts of the system.

### 7. Monitoring and Logging Layer
   - **New Relic One:** Monitoring tool used to identify bottlenecks, analyze performance, and ensure the application runs efficiently.
   - **Centralized Logging:** Services like ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) to collect, analyze, and visualize logs from all parts of the architecture.

### 8. Deployment and Infrastructure
   - **Container Orchestration (Kubernetes):** Used to manage deployment, scalability, and operation of Docker containers.
   - **PaaS/Infrastructure as Code (Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS CloudFormation):** Used for automating deployment and managing the infrastructure.

Session Management: Redis ensures session persistence across multiple server instances.

Security: WAF and authentication systems protect the application.

Monitoring and Logging: New Relic One and ELK Stack monitor performance and log events across the application.

Deployment: Kubernetes or PaaS services automate deployment and scalability of the infrastructure.

Deploy: Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS CloudFormation, Kubernetes, etc.

Security: WAF, Cloudflare
