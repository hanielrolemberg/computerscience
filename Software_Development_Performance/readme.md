# Local Variables
Local Variables are defined within a function or block and are only accessible within that scope.

- **Usage**: They store temporary data and are useful for managing state within functions.

# Vectorized Tasks (Matrix Computation)
Vectorized Tasks involve performing operations on whole arrays or matrices in a single step, leveraging hardware acceleration.

- **Usage**: Useful in scientific computing and data analysis to speed up computations.

# Asynchronous Programming (Async/Await)
Asynchronous Programming allows for non-blocking code execution, improving performance in I/O-bound operations.

- **Async/Await**: Syntax for handling asynchronous operations in a more readable and maintainable way compared to callbacks.

# Cache Resilient Data
Cache Resilient Data involves storing frequently accessed data in a cache to improve performance and reduce load times.

- **Usage**: Improves access speed and reduces the need for repetitive data retrieval from the primary storage.

# Lazy Loading
Lazy Loading defers the loading of data or resources until they are actually needed.

- **Usage**: Improves application performance and reduces initial load time by loading data on-demand.

# Stack and Heap
Stack and Heap are two types of memory used for different purposes in program execution.

- **Stack**: Stores local variables and function call information. It is managed in a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) manner.
- **Heap**: Stores dynamically allocated memory. It is managed manually and can grow or shrink in size.

# Big O Notation
Big O Notation describes the time complexity of an algorithm in terms of the size of its input.

- **Usage**: Helps in evaluating the efficiency of algorithms and predicting their performance with large inputs.

# Compiler Optimization Flags
Compiler Optimization Flags control the level of optimization performed by the compiler to enhance performance.

- **Usage**: Adjusts the trade-off between compilation time and execution speed.

# Optimal Data Structures
Optimal Data Structures are chosen to efficiently support operations such as insertion, deletion, and retrieval.

- **Usage**: Improves performance and resource usage based on specific requirements.

# Multi-threading
Multi-threading involves running multiple threads concurrently to perform tasks more efficiently.

- **Usage**: Enhances application performance and responsiveness by parallelizing tasks.
