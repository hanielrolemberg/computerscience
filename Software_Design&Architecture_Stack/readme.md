# Enterprise Patterns
Enterprise Patterns provide solutions for common business software problems.

- **DTOs**: Data Transfer Objects, used to transfer data between layers or systems.
- **Domain Models**: Represent the concepts of the business domain and their relationships.
- **Transaction Scripts**: Organize business logic by procedures that handle a single transaction.
- **Repositories**: Mediate between the domain and data mapping layers using a collection-like interface.
- **Mappers**: Translate data between the domain objects and data storage.
- **Value Objects**: Represent a descriptive aspect of the domain with no conceptual identity.

# Architectural Patterns
Architectural Patterns are proven ways to organize the architecture of a software system.

- **MVC (Model-View-Controller)**: Separates an application into three interconnected components.
- **DDD (Domain-Driven Design)**: Focuses on the core domain and domain logic, basing the design on the model of the domain.

# Architectural Styles
Architectural Styles define the structure and behavior of software systems.

- **Layered**: Organizes the system into layers, each with a specific responsibility.
- **Client-Server**: Divides the system into client and server components, where the client requests services and the server provides them.
- **Monolithic**: A single unified codebase for the entire application.
- **Component-Based**: Builds software from reusable and interchangeable components.

# Architectural Principles
Architectural Principles guide the decision-making process during the architecture design.

- **Policy vs Details**: Separates high-level policies from low-level implementation details.
- **Coupling & Cohesion**: Aims for low coupling and high cohesion to enhance modularity.
- **Dependencies**: Manages how components depend on each other.
- **Boundaries**: Defines clear boundaries within the system for better separation of concerns.

# Design Patterns
Design Patterns provide solutions to common problems in software design.

- **Observer**: Defines a dependency between objects so that when one changes state, all its dependents are notified.
- **Strategy**: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
- **Factory**: Creates objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.

# Design Principles
Design Principles guide how software should be structured and written.

- **Composition over Inheritance**: Favors composition of objects over class inheritance.
- **Hollywood Principle**: "Don't call us, we'll call you" â€“ components are given the control to handle actions.
- **Encapsulate What Varies**: Isolates the parts of the code that are subject to change.
- **SOLID**: A set of five principles for object-oriented design.
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Avoids duplication of code.
- **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**: Avoids adding functionality until it is necessary.

# Object-Oriented Programming
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects.

- **Inheritance**: Mechanism by which one class acquires the properties and behaviors of another class.
- **Polymorphism**: Ability to present the same interface for different underlying forms (data types).
- **Encapsulation**: Bundling the data and the methods that operate on the data within one unit.
- **Abstraction**: Hides complex implementation details and shows only the necessary features of an object.

# Programming Paradigms
Programming Paradigms are styles of programming.

- **Structured**: Focuses on improving the clarity, quality, and development time of software by using structured control flow.
- **Object-Oriented**: Organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic.
- **Functional**: Treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data.

# Clean Code
Clean Code is about writing code that is easy to understand and maintain.

- **Name**: Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
- **Construct**: Build simple and clear structures in the code.
- **Structure**: Organize the code in a logical way.
- **Style**: Maintain a consistent coding style.
- **Readability**: Write code that can be easily read and understood by others.
